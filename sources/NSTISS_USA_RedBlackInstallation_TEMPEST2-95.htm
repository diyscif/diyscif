      1. National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security
      Advisory Memorandum (NSTISSAM) TEMPEST/2-95, <I>RED/BLACK Installation Guidance
      </I>specifies RED/BLACK equipment/system installation guidance, provides
      an explanation of the TEMPEST policy concept, and addresses RED/BLACK
      considerations for facilities wherein national security information is processed.
      This publication supersedes National COMSEC Information Memorandum (NACSIM)
      5203, dated 30 June 1982. However, Appendix K of NACSIM 5203 will remain
      in effect until NACSI 4009, <I>Protected Distribution Systems, </I>dated
      30 December 1981, is superseded. NACSI 4009 is currently under revision.
      <P>
      2. TEMPEST security is a function of the TEMPEST characteristics of the
      processing equipment, the way the equipment is installed, the electromagnetic
      and physical characteristics of the facility, and the geographical environment
      where the facility is located.
      <P>
      3. The guidance identified herein will be considered by a Certified TEMPEST
      Technical Authority (CTTA) as part of the potential solution for facilities,
      system, and equipment that have been identified as requiring TEMPEST
      countermeasures. Only those specific criteria identified by the CTTA will
      be implemented.
      <P>

      <P>
      <B>1.1. General. </B>This <FONT SIZE=3>section contains introductory and
      administrative information associated with this document.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>1.2. Scope.</B> This document defines the guidance to consider during
      the design of facilities and for subsequent installation of equipment and
      systems that receive, transmit, manipulate, graph, store, archive, calculate,
      generate, print. or in any other manner process national security information.
      This guidance is part of the potential solution for facilities, systems and
      equipment identified as requiring TEMPEST countermeasures.
      <P>
      <B>1.3. Content.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>The text includes a brief overview of the
      TEMPEST national policy and provides RED/BLACK installation guidance that
      may be identified by the Certified TEMPEST Technical Authority (CTTA) as
      part of the solution for systems and facilities that require the application
      of TEMPEST countermeasures.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>1.4. Revision.</B> This <FONT SIZE=3>document correlates to the previous
      issue (NACSIM 5203) in concept only. The content has been extensively changed
      and reorganized to reflect current policy considerations and emerging
      technology.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>1.5. Policy.</B> The <I>National Policy on the Control of Compromising
      Emanations</I> (NSTISSP 300) and its implementing instructions. <I>TEMPEST
      Countermeasures for Facilities </I>(NSTISSI 7000), and NONSTOP Countermeasures
      (NSTISSI 7001) establish the policy that certain systems and facilities that
      process national security information (NSI) must be reviewed by a CTTA. If
      such a review is required and the review determines that TEMPEST countermeasures
      are required. the CTTA will consider a variety of methods that can be applied
      to the system/facility to achieve TEMPEST security. The RED/BLACK guidance
      contained in this document will be considered by the CTTA along with other
      measures (e.g.. TEMPEST Zoning, TEMPEST suppressed equipment and shielding)
      to determine the most cost-effective countermeasures to achieve TEMPEST security.
      Only those RED/BLACK criteria specifically identified by the CTTA will be
      implemented.
      <P>
      <B>1.6. Application.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>The guidance contained herein, when
      specified by a CTTA, is applicable to U.S. Government departments, agencies
      and contractors.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>1.7. Comments and Recommendations.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Revisions to this
      publication will be made as appropriate. Comments and recommendations are
      encouraged. Government organizations should submit their comments to their
      appropriate government or agency authority. Department and agency authorities
      may submit their comments to:</FONT>

	<B>RED/BLACK INSTALLATION RECOMMENDATIONS</B>
      </H3>
      <P>
      <B>3.1. General. </B><FONT SIZE=3>There are many variables within a facility
      that can affect the opportunity for the collection of compromising emanations.
      Chief among these are the radiation characteristics of the information processing
      equipment, placement of signal and power cables. presence of fortuitous
      conductors, radio frequency (RF) attenuation of building materials, and the
      amount of inspectable space surrounding the facility.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>3.2. Installation Recommendations.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Table 3-1 summarizes
      the general RED/BLACK installation recommendations to meet NSTISSP No. 300,
      NSTISSI No. 7000 and NSTISSI NO. 7001 policy criteria. The matrix of the
      table for equipment and facilities with TEMPEST zone ratings was derived
      using guidance in NSTISSAM TEMPEST/2-92, <I>Procedures for TEMPEST Zoning</I>.
      <B>The cognizant CTTA must be consulted in the initial planning phases for
      facilities that will process classified information. </B></FONT>This is
      especially important for large projects where the architectural and engineering
      design and documentation phase is a major cost item. The CTTA has the
      responsibility for conducting or validating TEMPEST reviews and recommending
      TEMPEST countermeasures, including RED/BLACK installation measures. There
      should be no commitment of funds without CTTA concurrence. Failure to consult
      the CTTA could result in installation of unnecessary and/or expensive
      countermeasures or the omission of needed countermeasures.
      <P>
      <B>3.3. Use of Table 3-1.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>The installation recommendations
      in Table 3-1 are for RED equipment (boxes along the left side) installed
      in one of three facility TEMPEST zones (boxes along the top</FONT> side).
      The recommendations in the matrix are identified in the pages following the
      table.
      <P>
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Facilities are listed by TEMPEST zone rating and surrounding inspectable
	  space (IS). Facility zone ratings are the preferred method to determine facility
	  TEMPEST characteristics since they are derived from the measured RF attenuation
	  provided by the facility structure, the effects of fortuitous conductors,
	  and the surrounding inspectable space. The inspectable space distances should
	  be used only if the facility has not been TEMPEST zoned.
      </UL>
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Equipment TEMPEST zone ratings should be used if available. Zone D has been
	  combined with Zone C for the purpose of defining the recommendations in this
	  section. If an equipment has not been TEMPEST zoned and no TEMPEST profile
	  data is available, the "All Other RED Equipment" category should be used.
      </UL>
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  When installing a system that contains equipment with multiple zone ratings,
	  the system should be installed in compliance with the most stringent equipment
	  zone recommendations. For example, if a system containing equipment rated
	  Zone A, Zone B and Zone C is to be installed in a Facility Zone C space,
	  the entire system should be installed to meet equipment Zone C recommendations.
	  The resulting recommendations are identified in the matrix box at the intercept
	  that is three boxes to the right of the Equipment Zone C box and three boxes
	  down from the Facility Zone C box. This identifies Recommendation 1.
      </UL>

      Recommendation distances are stated in Metric units. The approximate English
      equivalents are:

	GUIDANCE FOR TEMPEST INTEGRITY
      </H3>
      <P>
      <B>4.1. General.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>This section briefly describes the TEMPEST
      phenomena and the basic installation criteria to achieve TEMPEST integrity
      of national security information processing equipment and systems. The other
      appendices in this document contain specific installation and countermeasures
      guidance for various systems. NACSIM 5000 has additional information on the
      sources of TEMPEST signals, the types of TEMPEST signals, and the methods
      of signal propagation.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>4.2. TEMPEST Basics.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>TEMPEST is an unclassified short
      name referring to investigations and studies of Compromising Emanations (CE).
      CE are defined as unintentional data related or intelligence bearing signals,
      which if intercepted and analyzed, disclose the NSI transmitted, received,
      handled, or otherwise processed by any information processing equipment.
      These intercepted signals need not be of great magnitude to compromise the
      NSI. Receiving intercept instruments can make use of even a small amount
      of energy.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>4.2.1. Generation of CE.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>When equipment process NSI,
      the possibility exists that CE can be generated. Time and frequency
      characteristics of these emanations are normally unknown. However, the mechanisms
      of NSI emanation introduction into an escape medium, characteristics of various
      equipment under test, and experience allow estimation of their characteristics.
      In practice the more common types of CE are attenuated RED baseband signals,
      spurious carriers modulated by RED baseband signals, and impulsive
      emanations.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>4.2.2. CE Sources.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>To determine the extent of CE and
      the necessary countermeasures to apply, equipment must be considered individually
      and as components of a system. Any circuit processing NSI can be a source
      of CE. A system could emit signals beyond the defined boundaries, even when
      all equipment and components comprising the system individually meet TEMPEST
      standards. This could occur because of the interrelationship of components,
      equipment interface characteristics, lengths, locations and shielding of
      interconnecting signal and control lines and methods of grounding each unit
      within the system. There are two basic sources of CE:</FONT>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>4.2.2.1. Functional Sources.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Functional sources are those
	designed for the specific purpose of generating electromagnetic energy. Examples
	are switching transistors, oscillators, signal generators. synchronizers,
	line drivers and line relays.</FONT>
	<P>
	<B>4.2.2.2. Incidental Sources.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Incidental sources are those
	NOT designed for the specific purpose of generating electromagnetic energy,
	but can generate energy incidental to normal operations. These sources of
	CE can include all electromechanical and electronic equipment and systems
	used to process NSI (e.g., communications equipment, recording and duplicating
	equipment. automatic data processing equipment. and their
	installations).</FONT>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>
      <B>4.3. RED/BLACK Basics.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>The RED/BLACK concept. by definition,
      establishes areas for placement of equipment processing NSI (RED) that are
      separate and unique from areas with equipment processing non-NSI (BLACK).
      The concept is composed of two parts: physical separation and electrical
      separation.</FONT>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>a. Physical Separation.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>All equipment, wirelines, components
	and systems that process NSI are considered RED. All equipment, wirelines.
	components and systems that process encrypted NSI and non-NSI are considered
	BLACK The RED/BLACK concept is to establish</FONT> minimum guidance for physical
	separation to decrease the probability that electromagnetic emissions from
	RED devices might couple to BLACK systems. Section 3 specifies the recommended
	separation for different equipment.
	<P>
	<B>b. Electrical Separation.</B> Electrical separation ensures that every
	signal conductor from a RED device is routed only to another RED device,
	or is encrypted before connection with a BLACK device. Electrical separation
	addresses signal distribution, power distribution, and grounding. Switches
	and/or other devices used to interface between RED and BLACK circuits/equipment
	should exhibit the following port-to-port isolation characteristics, as
	applicable:

      <P>
      <B>4.3.1. Facility Considerations.</B> The most cost-effective application
      of RED/BLACK countermeasures will vary depending on characteristics of the
      facility and the equipment operated within the facility. The first step in
      the selection of proper RED/BLACK controls for the facility is the identification
      of the facility TEMPEST Zone ratings, equipment TEMPEST Zone ratings. and
      facility inspectable space. Table 3-1 and Section 3 contain the RED/BLACK
      installation recommendations as a function of these variables.
      <P>
      <B>4.3.2. Physical Security Considerations.</B> Physical security is a key
      element in deciding what RED/BLACK countermeasures will be adopted and is
      an important part of the necessary safeguards for equipment and systems that
      process NSI. The user is responsible for adopting the requisite physical
      security standards and procedures according to current directives. Physical
      security should be addressed at the beginning of any new facility or renovation
      project. Security officials, the CTTA. and/or others responsible for building
      construction or modification should be involved during the planning stages
      of a project.
      <P>
      <B>4.4. Signal Cables.</B> Installations can use shielded metallic cables
      and nonmetallic optical fiber cables to interconnect signals and to meet
      RED/BLACK separation recommendations.
      <P>
      <B>4.4.1. Shielded Metallic Cables.</B> Selection of metallic cable types
      varies according to equipment design. Jacketed multiconductor twisted pair
      cables consist of insulated, shielded pairs, or a bundle of twisted pairs
      contained within a single shield. Each shield (of a twisted pair or bundle
      of twisted pairs) should include an uninsulated and tinned drain wire. This
      drain wire should have a lay such that it will <FONT SIZE=3>contact the shield
      throughout its length. To reduce radiation of CE, metallic cables should
      have a minimum of one overall braided metallic shield, with the shield terminated
      at both ends to the grounding network. The shield should not be used as a
      signal return path. A drain wire is not required in braided copper or
      outside-plant-type aluminum foil shielded telephone cable.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>4.4.1.1. Cable Characteristics.</B> Cables should have an overall shield
      composed of 85 to 90 percent tinned copper braid coverage. Consider the following
      when selecting cables: voltage breakdown, insulation type, jacket material
      and color. Effective shielding for a cable is achieved by meeting the
      requirements of MIL-C-23437 and by using proper cable shield termination.
      Crosstalk can appear on adjacent pairs. Refer to MIL-C-23437 for specific
      measurement techniques.
      <P>
      <B>4.4.1.2. Shield Termination. </B>Both ends of the overall shield should
      have 360 degree terminations. Shields for twisted pairs and bundles of twisted
      pairs are normally terminated at both ends. Designers and installers must
      be aware that terminating cable shields at both ends can cause signal ground
      loop problems resulting in TEMPEST emanations or safety concerns. In these
      cases, the designers and installers should consider terminating the cable
      shield at one end only, or replacing the cable with a nonmetallic optical
      fiber cable. Long pigtail and long ground wire shield terminations drastically
      reduce shielding effectiveness and in certain frequency ranges can completely
      nullify the inherent shielding capability of a cable. If pigtail termination
      is required, the pigtail should be as short as possible and should be bonded
      to a low impedance radio frequency ground such as ground, plate, chassis
      or wide ground bus. A long slender ground wire is not an effective RF ground
      and can instead be an effective antenna.

      <B>4.4.2. <FONT SIZE=3>Optical Fiber Cables.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=3> A fiber
      optics system converts an electrical signal to an optical signal, transmits
      the signal through an optical fiber, and converts the signal to an electrical
      signal at the receive end of the fiber. Although optical converters can create
      TEMPEST emanations from the electrical portion of their circuitry, optical
      systems have several advantages over metallic signal cables when used to
      transmit RED information:</FONT>
      <P>
      <UL>

	  Because optical fibers are nonmetallic, they do not conduct or radiate radio
	  frequency interference (RFI). Optical fibers are virtually unaffected by
	  electromagnetic fields (i.e., electromagnetic interference (EMI) or RFI),
	  effectively eliminating cable crosstalk.
      </UL>

      <B>4.4.2.1. <FONT SIZE=3>Applications of Optical Fiber Cable
      Systems.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=3> Optical fiber cable systems can be used
      in RED and BLACK distribution systems to prevent the unintended transmission
      of TEMPEST signals outside the inspectable space. Specific optical systems
      can also be approved as a PDS (see current PDS standard) for secure transmission
      of plain text NSI to remote areas of the same security classification. While
      optical fiber cables used for this purpose will not radiate CE, the cables
      are still vulnerable to tampering, requiring appropriate physical security
      as with any RED cable. See MIL-STD-188-111 for interoperability and performance
      standards of optical fiber cable systems for military application.</FONT>

      cables within the same cladding should be restricted to either RED or BLACK
      information to preclude compromise through misconnections. Separate RED and
      BLACK dielectric multifiber cables can be routed in a common RED distribution
      system provided the end equipment are managed to preclude misconnections.
      All optical fiber cables should be clearly marked, labeled or tagged as RED
      or BLACK according to purpose to maintain complete accountability. Unused
      optical fiber cables should be marked as such.</FONT>

      to control the routing of signal cables to prevent mixing cables by controlling
      access to the route. Properly installed wireways can also aid in shielding
      cables contained therein and thereby reducing electromagnetic radiation.
      RED and BLACK cables should use separate wireways with physical separations
      as recommended in Section 3. Many signal lines that egress the inspectable
      space are contained in a pipe, conduit. duct or other conductive material.
      This outer physical layer can become a fortuitous conductor and could require
      isolation. A CTTA will determine if isolation is required. the best location

      <P>
      <B>4.6.1. Signal Line Isolation.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>BLACK lines and other
      electrically conductive materials that egress the inspectable space are potential
      carriers of CE that can inadvertently couple to the lines. An extensive variety
      and quantity of BLACK lines and other conductive materials can cross the
      boundary of the inspectable space of a facility. Various signal line isolation
      techniques can be used to protect the signal line, the distribution system
      or other fortuitous conductors from conducting compromising signals beyond
      secure areas. Before employing these isolation methods, the facility and
      equipment should be evaluated to determine if the minimum separation
      recommendations of Section 3 can be met. Consider signal line isolation only
      if the</FONT> minimum separation recommendations cannot be met.
      <P>
      <B>4.6.2. Assessing the Need for Signal Isolation.</B> When the minimum
      separation recommendations of Section 3 cannot be met, there are many factors
      that combine to determine if a specific facility and equipment complement
      should use signal line isolation techniques. The CTTA should decide whether
      compromising signals are detectable on the signal lines in areas where
      unauthorized personnel could exploit them with little chance of being discovered.
      Without knowledge of the results of an instrumented TEMPEST test at the site,
      there will usually be insufficient information to make this decision. Experienced
      TEMPEST personnel can decide based on known factors that can include equipment
      TEMPEST characteristics, cable shielding, equipment separation distances
      from the potential conductors, physical access controls to the distribution
      of the conductors, the security classification of the NSI processed, and
      the relative threat of exploitation based on the geographic location of the
      facility, and the guidelines of NSTISSI 7000. To ensure that the facility
      is adequately protected for future equipment configurations, consider the
      frequency of changing, adding and relocating equipment. At a specific facility
      some conductors require isolation while others do not, based on equipment
      layout, signal line distribution and other factors. Isolation of conductors
      may not be possible for reasons like life, safety or prohibitive cost. When
      conflicts occur, consult the cognizant CTTA to develop the best approach.

      <B>4.6.3. Passive Signal Line Filters.</B> Passive filters are installed
      on signal lines to block signals outside a specified frequency range. Lowpass
      filters are used to pass the intended baseband signal and greatly attenuate
      all higher frequency signals. Bandpass filters, which suppress signals above
      and below a specified frequency range, and highpass filters, which pass signals
      above a specified frequency, are also available for special requirements.
      Filters are available with different signal cutoff frequencies to meet the
      requirements of a variety of signaling rates. Previously, telephone line
      filters were required to pass only the analog voice signals. To avoid signal
      degradation or stoppage in digital data transmission on telephone networks,
      select telephone line filters compatible with the format and speed of the
      intended signal.
      <P>
      <B>4.6.3.1. Lowpass Filters.</B> Passive lowpass signal line filters should
      meet the guidance below and the requirements of MIL-F-15733. For most effective
      performance, signal line filter design should meet the specific requirements
      for their particular application, however, an existing filter design that
      approximates the desired characteristics can be more economical. Two types
      of signals require filtering: analog signals (i.e., voice or the tone output
      of modems), and digital signals (i.e., mark/space square waves). Filter behavior
      and performance for each of these types of signals are considered separately.
      <P>
      <B>4.6.3.1.1. Analog Signal line Filters.</B> Analog signal line filters
      are usually designed to match a balanced 600 ohm signal pair (two 300 ohm
      filters). These filters can introduce moderate phase and amplitude perturbations
      in the 1500 Hz to 3300 Hz portion of the passband, even when employed in
      an impedance matched system. If there is an impedance mismatch to the filter,
      these perturbations will increase approximately in proportion to the extent
      of the mismatch. Modems can tolerate a minimum of phase and amplitude distortion
      introduced by signal line filters. For applications of this type, the options
      are to use a simple filter designed to introduce minimal phase and amplitude
      distortion in the frequency band of the modem (0 to 3300 Hz) or to design
      an expensive, multi-element, compensated filter.
      <P>
      <B>4.6.3.1.2. Inductive-Capacitive (LC) Signal Line Filters.</B> LC signal
      line filters tend to "ring" when the input signal is a square wave. Using
      these filters to remove undesired frequency components from digital signals
      generate stringent design problems. The best square wave performance can
      be obtained from an LC filter that is both driven and terminated in its
      characteristic impedance. Some ringing will occur, and there will be 6 dB
      attenuation of the signaling voltage (i.e.. +6 volts to the filter driver
      will produce +3 volts out to the line). This degree of signal attenuation
      is usually not acceptable in a digital system. Two alternate approaches are
      available to provide minimum desired signal attenuation, with only a moderate
      increase in ringing. First, a filter driven with a matched source impedance
      can be terminated in a high impedance (x10 or higher) without appreciable
      signal attenuation and with only a moderate increase in ringing. Second.
      when an inductance input type filter is employed, a low impedance device
      can be used if the filter is terminated in its characteristic impedance.
      In general, a filter terminated in its characteristic impedance can be used
      at a bit rate approaching 1/3 the filter cutoff frequency. If the impedance
      is substantially mismatched, excessive ringing will occur and the bit rate
      that can be passed is drastically reduced.
      <P>
      <B>4.6.3.1.3. Digital Signal Line Filters.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Filters driven
      directly from keying contacts must have inductive inputs or there will be
      excessive contact arcing resulting in rapid contact deterioration. Ringing
      will be moderate if the filter is terminated in its characteristic impedance.
      Without proper termination. the filtered signal will have excessive ringing
      that severely limits the usable bit rate. Filter designs developed to solve
      specific problems are necessarily expensive. Changing the signal patch to
      provide a balanced signal pair matching the characteristic impedance of a
      filter is usually impossible. Most signal line filters are designed for balanced
      600 ohm transmission line systems and are available as either dual 300 ohm
      or 300 ohm units intended to be used in pairs. They have also been designed
      primarily for analog signals in the 0 to 3 kHz frequency range. Unfortunately,
      these filters have been employed in many digital applications for which they
      were not designed. Most digital systems do not employ balanced transmission
      techniques in that one lead of a transmission pair is driven at 6 volts for
      space bits, and 0 volts for mark bits. Also, the input impedance of low level
      digital devices usually is at least 6,000 ohms and can be as high as 100,000
      ohms, while the output driving impedance of digital drivers can be only a
      few ohms. This suggests that 300 ohm analog filters will give unsatisfactory
      performances in most digital circuits. If filtering is necessary for specific
      digital applications, special filter designs should be developed that are
      tailored to the specific problem. An alternative is to change the signaling
      path to a transmission link using a balanced signal pair with matched source
      and sink impedances. A standard filter can then be inserted in the transmission
      link. This alternative is particularly attractive from an engineering viewpoint
      when the signaling path leaves the inspectable space for a long run.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>4.6.4. Active Signal Line Filters.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Active filters are
      frequency selective devices that employ electronic impedance, current, and
      voltage modifying elements, requiring the application of power to use their
      filtering properties. As opposed to passive filters, active filters are
      essentially one-way devices that use impedance mismatch as the primary basis
      for filtering action. Note also that the phase delay. passband. and stop
      band characteristics of active filters can be widely divergent from those
      of standard passive filters. Active filters are more readily adaptable to
      digital applications than are passive filters and can be specifically designed
      to process analog signals with a minimum of distortion.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>4.6.4.1. Linear Filters.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Active linear filters normally
      consist of linear amplifiers that incorporate frequency selective
      resistance-capacitance (RC) networks, either as negative feedback elements
      or in line filter elements, or both. Filters of this type can be configured
      to be lowpass, bandpass, highpass, or band rejection types. A well-designed
      active filter provides a greater degree of attenuation of unwanted signals
      at a higher cost. The small size and versatile characteristics can justify
      the added cost. Active filters are currently being produced in modular form
      to produce chips that offer a greater variety of filtering
      characteristics.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>4.6.4.2. Saturated Amplifiers.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>One type of active filter
      for digital signals is a combination of saturated input and output amplifiers
      coupled by means of a single RC network. If an active feed through capacitor
      is employed between the input and the output compartments, independent power
      supply provided. and adequate shielding designed into the enclosure, attenuation
      of transverse mode unwanted signals of at least 100 dB can be obtained. Saturated
      amplifiers should not be used by themselves because they do not provide
      common</FONT> mode isolation. The provision of an optical path instead of
      a conducted or capacitive penetration of the RED/BLACK shield adds minimum
      complexity and enhances security.
      <P>
      <B>4.6.5. Isolators.</B> The common characteristic of isolators is that they
      can provide dc and ground system isolation between input and output circuits,
      thus reducing the possibility of signal conducting ground loops. Isolators
      also offer design possibilities for non-low level signals in and low level
      signals out. or vice versa, polar-to-neutral-to-polar conversion, and independent
      dc levels for input and output circuits. To obtain these characteristics,
      separate power sources are necessary for input and output circuits. Isolators
      can be subdivided into the following functional types: magnetic-, acoustic-.
      and photon-coupled devices.
      <P>
      <B>4.6.5.1. Magnetic-coupled Isolators.</B> The simplest form of a
      magnetic-coupled isolator is a conventional electromechanical relay. Such
      a device provides dc isolation, but is limited to low baud rates, and unless
      it is of a very special shielded design, provides only meager higher frequency
      attenuation. Another form of magnetic-coupled isolator is the transformer-coupled
      type that employs a modulated oscillator in the input operating at a frequency
      at least ten times the highest baud rate, while the output is equipped with
      either a suitable phase, frequency shift, or amplitude detector. Effective
      passive filtering of the input and output signal lines is essential to prevent
      the modulated high frequency signal from coupling out of the isolator onto
      the input and output lines. Standard relays have been used as isolators in
      teleprinter (TTY) systems for many years, but their principal capability
      has been dc isolation and level changing. Transformer-coupled isolators have
      not been highly successful as digital devices, but as analog devices. transformer
      coupling is used extensively to provide dc isolation between equipment and
      balanced input and output lines.
      <P>
      <B>4.6.5.2. Acoustic-coupled Isolators.</B> Acoustic-coupled isolators are
      similar to transformer-coupled isolators in that both employ a modulated
      oscillator and suitable detecting devices. In the acoustical device, the
      oscillator drives a transducer, which in turn excites a receiving transducer
      through some nonconducting medium. The problems encountered with this type
      isolator are similar to those of the magnetic-coupled type. Very few applications
      of this type device have been achieved.
      <P>
      <B>4.6.5.3. Photon-coupled Isolators.</B> Photon-coupled (optical) isolators
      are available in many different configurations. These range from integrated
      circuit components (containing a light source and detector and providing
      only dc and very low frequency isolation) to isolators that employ optical
      coupling through a waveguide (capable of providing more than 120 dB of both
      common mode and transverse mode isolation from dc through 10 GHz. This definition
      applies to both forward and backward (output-to-input) isolation. Common
      mode signal isolation is the degree of signal attenuation in decibels between
      the shorted input and the shorted output of the isolation device when the
      signal source is between the shorted input of the isolation device and ground
      reference. The measuring equipment is connected between the shorted output
      and the ground reference. Photon-coupled isolators are available for both
      digital and analog signal applications. Digital signaling speeds of several
      million bits per second and analog bandwidths of several megahertz can be
      accomplished. Photon-coupled isolators use lightwave technologies to couple
      signals between two points via use of an optical fiber cable. When the optical
      fiber cable is installed in a waveguide beyond cutoff, the isolator is ideal
      for use in shielded installations where conducting penetrations are kept
      at a minimum. Four types of isolators are identified by intended application.

      more than 120 dB isolation (0 to 10 GHz) for lines passing through any equipment
      or equipment area interface requiring protection. The reason for this stringent
      requirement is to prevent a conductive or capacitive path for compromising
      information from the RED equipment area to the BLACK equipment area and the
      uncontrolled area. Take notice that one line filter cannot perform the function
      of an isolator, since a conductive path is always present within the passband
      of the filter. The use of filters is not recommended because ground current
      loops are generated by the low impedance to ground that the filter inherently
      has at frequencies above its cutoff frequency. The ground currents present
      the possibility of compromise.</FONT>

      <P>
      <B>4.6.5.3.2. Advantages of Photon-coupled Isolators.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>The
      advantages of using photon-coupled isolators are: (1) elimination of the
      electrically conductive path of undesired signals between the input and output
      modules; (2) attenuation of common mode signals by use of waveguides operating
      below cutoff as attenuators; (3) elimination of undesired transverse mode
      signals by filtering, pulse reshaping, or pulse regeneration. The isolators
      are usually mounted inside an RFI cabinet or on the wall of a shielded room.
      The penetration of the shield is in the form of a waveguide tube through
      which the optical path passes. The dimensions of the waveguide tube are normally
      chosen to prevent the passing of RF energy below 10 GHz.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>4.7. Power Distribution.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>The power distribution scheme
      must be protected from exploitation of CE that might be developed in the
      system. The scheme must conform to the life and safety provisions of the
      Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), the National Electrical Code (NEC),
      and local building codes. MIL-HDBK-411 contains guidance for power distribution
      design. The following paragraphs address the proper design of a power
      distribution scheme that will satisfy RED/BLACK recommendations.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>4.7.1. The Power Requirement.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>The power requirements
      of a facility can be divided into two groups -- power for the mission equipment
      (technical) and power for the supporting services</FONT> (nontechnical).
      Supporting services include lighting, heating, ventilating, air conditioning,
      etc. By providing a separate service feeder dedicated to the sensitive equipment
      and controlling its distribution, the opportunity for unauthorized detection
      of compromising signals on those lines is reduced. Powerline conduction occurs
      when plain text information is transferred onto the powerline by RED equipment,
      or radiated through free space and coupled onto the powerlines. If a facility
      is processing NSI, power is sometimes divided into RED and BLACK power. RED
      power provides isolation for those non-TEMPEST approved equipment processing
      NSI. BLACK power is provided for equipment processing non-NSI because power
      isolation is not required. This separation prevents conducted emissions from
      RED equipment being coupled through BLACK equipment to BLACK lines that might
      egress the inspectable space. Adequate internal filtering permits use of
      BLACK power for Level I TEMPEST compliant equipment and systems. In addition
      to separate distribution facilities, the measures outlined in the subsequent
      paragraphs for containment and suppression of conducted emissions apply to
      RED power. RED power distribution must be designed such that neither BLACK
      equipment nor utility equipment is connected to it. The design and installation
      of power systems require judicious selection of the primary and auxiliary
      power sources, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) or other power conditioning
      equipment, secondary substations, protective measures, and the distribution
      system to attain the maximum overall system performance with the most
      cost-effective design.
      <P>
      <B>4.7.2. Power Conditioning/Isolation.</B> Facilities using sensitive
      solid-state equipment often include devices to condition the electrical power
      by removing or suppressing harmonic distortion, surges, sags, spikes, and
      electrical noise. Chiefly, powerline filters, isolation (Faraday shielded)
      transformers, UPS, and power regulators are used. When the facility transformer
      is located within the inspectable space and draws an average load of 100
      kilovoltamperes (kVA) or more. filtering the ac power is not required.
      <P>
      <B>4.7.2.1. Powerline Filters.</B> The passive LC filter has long been used
      to remove unwanted RFI from conductors of all types. Such filtering has been
      in general use to prevent RFI from interfering with equipment operations.
      The TEMPEST program employs filters to prevent RFI generated in equipment
      from escaping as conducted CE. When applied to the treatment of powerlines,
      two schools of thought exist: bulk filtering for the entire facility, and
      filtering only equipment as required. Bulk filtering is expensive and generally
      less effective than filtering at the equipment. Filtering at the component
      and/or cabinet level is a more practical and economical approach for isolating
      RED electromagnetic environments from BLACK electromagnetic environments.
      Vendors' catalogs typically provide detailed information for available filters.
      If the appropriate filter is not available but is required for secure equipment
      operation, the following information should be provided to the filter
      manufacturer for custom design of a filter:
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	Operating line voltage<BR>
	Operating frequency<BR>
	Source impedance<BR>
	Load impedance<BR>
	Load current<BR>
	Desired bandpass frequency<BR>
	Acceptable insertion loss
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>
      Powerline filters are not considered an assured method of adequately suppressing
      CE. Custom designing powerline filters for each equipment is a preferred
      method of preventing conducted CE from being introduced on powerlines. The
      required insertion loss can be more readily attained with equipment filters
      because saturation of inductors is a lesser problem due to lower current
      and because impedance mismatch can be minimized due to known characteristics.
      <P>
      <B>4.7.2.2. Isolation Transformers.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Isolation transformers
      are principally used to break ground loops to reduce common mode and differential
      mode noise. An isolation transformer equipped with triple Faraday shields
      is very effective in reducing conducted emission in both the power mains
      and the branch feeds. The transformer can be 1: 1 ratio or stepdown. Its
      installation in the facility should be as close to the load equipment as
      possible, preferably in the same room, It should also be installed per NEC
      Article 250-5(d) as a separately derived system and, as such, establishes
      a new fault protection subsystem. It should not be tied to the green wire
      serving the power main side, as this defeats the intent of both the NEC for
      protection and the use of this type of transformer to break ground loops.
      Further, some isolation transformers can be designed with the ground and
      neutral conductors being common to the primary and secondary windings. This
      reduces the isolation effectiveness of the transformer.</FONT>

      <FONT SIZE=3>Many installations using computer or process control equipment
      employ UPS and voltage regulators as a method of providing glitch free power.
      Certain aspects of UPS aid in containment of conducted emissions as discussed
      in the following paragraphs.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>4.7.2.3.1. Solid-state UPS (SSUPS).</B> <FONT SIZE=3>In theory, the SSUPS
      offers high isolation of conducted emissions by the nature of its operation.
      SSUPS takes the incoming ac power through a dc converter or rectifier. The
      filtering section of the rectifier should greatly attenuate conducted emissions.
      The dc voltage is supplied to an inverter section that synthesizes a sinewave
      that is filtered to reduce the probability of a conducted emission feeding
      back to the power mains. For most security processing applications, an SSUPS
      can be powered from either RED or BLACK power.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>4.7.2.3.2. Rotating <FONT SIZE=3>UPS.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=3> Whether
      a rotating UPS is constructed as a motor generator or a no-break generator
      using an inertia flywheel, its basic principles of operation provide a degree
      of isolation between power mains and loads. The typical structure is an ac
      synchronous motor driving a generator. Such systems offer high immunity of
      the load from line disturbance. Some configurations do not provide isolation
      for conducted emissions. This is particularly true if the ac motor is mounted
      on a common shaft with the generator and in a common housing. If the motor
      and generator shafts and housings are electrically separated and capacitively
      decoupled, the emissions can be contained. Systems employing dc motors offer
      some isolation regardless of the configuration. Better isolation can be achieved
      if the housings are electrically and capacitively decoupled. In such systems,
      conducted emissions are suppressed in the dc power supply driving the motor
      and in the battery system.</FONT>

      <B>4.8. Grounding System.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>The grounding scheme in a facility
      is composed of an earth electrode subsystem, lightning protection subsystem,
      fault protection subsystem, and signal reference subsystem. The signal reference
      subsystem is either a single point grounding design or a multiple point
      equipotential ground plane design, and it is of particular interest for control
      of TEMPEST emanations. Each grounding subsystem has a separate and distinct
      function as described in MIL-HDBK-419. Standards for grounding and bonding
      are provided in MIL-STD-188-124. Guidance on the construction of an equipotential
      grid can be found in Federal Information Processing Standards Publication
      (FIPS PUB) 94 and MIL-HDBK-419, Volume II. Pertinent aspects of the single
      point and equipotential grounding methods are described here to highlight
      the security ramifications of each method.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>4.8.1. Equipotential Plane.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>An equipotential ground plane
      is a mass, or masses of conducting material that. when bonded together, offers
      negligible impedance to current flow. In any electrical circuit, it is essential
      to provide a low impedance path for signals to return from the load back
      to the generator. Noise in a signal line can often be attributed to the noise
      signal and current finding a lower impedance return than the intended path.
      Where filters are employed in circuit design, unwanted signals are removed
      from the lines and shunted to</FONT> another conductor. Any signal shunted
      to the ground system might circulate through multiple branches of the ground
      system to return to the source. Due to uncontrolled conductor lengths and
      impedance mismatches, such signals could be radiated from the conductors.
      Guidance on the construction of an equipotential grid can be found FIPS PUB
      94 and MIL-HDBK-419, Volume II. All equipment signal ground terminals are
      bonded to the grid with leads as short as possible, but should not exceed
      1/20 of the wavelength for the highest frequency of interest.
      <P>
      <B>4.8.2. Single-Point Ground.</B> Sometimes a single-point ground can be
      the only viable solution for a signal grounding scheme. From the TEMPEST
      viewpoint, a single point ground can satisfy the grounding requirement at
      facilities where: (1) no station ground meeting the criteria of MIL-HDBK-419,
      Volume II exists, (2) station ground exists, but is not accessible, and (3)
      it is neither cost-effective nor practical to construct an equipotential
      grounding system.
      <P>
      <B>4.8.3. Fault Protection Ground.</B> The National Electrical Code (NEC),
      Article 250, requires equipping electrical power installations with a fault
      protection grounding subsystem. Its purpose is to establish a common reference
      and to provide an uninterrupted current path from the powered equipment back
      to the first service disconnect or transformer. When a fault occurs in the
      equipment, the grounding conductor will cause a circuit breaker to trip and
      reduce the hazard to personnel. Use of metallic conduits and wireways as
      a fault return path is not recommended for data processing and communications
      equipment. The probable electrical discontinuity at conduit or wireway joints
      can cause a high impedance that will generate noise. Each equipment that
      is hardwired to the power source or each power outlet servicing equipment
      should be connected to a dedicated, contiguous green wire protective ground
      extending to the service disconnect. The protective grounding subsystem is
      unacceptable as a signal reference ground for the following reasons. First,
      the NEC does not intend the green wire system to carry current except during
      a fault. Second, there is no control over the distribution of signals. Third,
      the power distribution system is susceptible to noise that can disrupt signal
      circuits.
      <P>
      <B>4.8.4. Isolated Ground.</B> Although not specifically intended for TEMPEST
      treatment, an isolated ground power distribution scheme can enhance line
      isolation concepts. To minimize mutual inductive coupling, the power cable
      is not run in conduit. This distribution scheme consists of isolated ground
      outlets, an isolated power distribution panel. and an insulated grounding
      conductor. The isolated ground outlet is designed with no electrical bond
      between the grounding terminal and the frame of the outlet This prevents
      automatic coupling of the ground to the conduit, which would destroy the
      isolated ground. The ground conductor should be connected between the grounding
      terminal on the outlet and the grounding bus in the power distribution panel.
      The grounding and neutral bus bars should be insulated, isolating them from
      the distribution panel, conduit, and each other at this point. The grounding
      conductor is then connected from the ground bus to the grounding point of
      the facility main power switch gear. At this point it becomes common to the
      neutral conductor and other grounding conductors used throughout the facility.
      Only operational equipment should be connected to the power panel. Lights,
      air handling systems, utility devices and housekeeping equipment should be
      connected to a separate panel since they can induce unwanted noise into the
      system. Use of an isolated ground power distribution scheme will effectively
      isolate TEMPEST equipment from other electrical devices in the facility,
      but is not intended to replace other required powerline isolation devices.
      <P>
      <B>4.9. Administrative Support Equipment.</B> Any facility processing NSI
      will likely contain electronic administrative support systems not directly
      associated with the classified processing. This can include administrative
      telephones, paging systems, alarm detection systems, building utilities,
      radio and television receivers. and miscellaneous unclassified computer and
      communications equipment such as facsimiles, television monitors, video cassette
      recorders, portable computers, modems and local area network components If
      not installed according to RED/BLACK criteria. these systems can provide
      a conductive path for TEMPEST emanations to escape the facility. These components
      are sometimes personally owned and are often portable, which increases the
      likelihood they can be incorrectly installed in a secure facility. Administrative
      controls are recommended to establish local procedures to control the location
      and use of administrative support equipment within a secure facility. The
      use of wireless systems should be prohibited in all cases.
      <P>
      <B>4.9.1. Telephone Systems.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Administrative telephone systems
      are a potential source for fortuitous conduction of CE due to their proximity
      to building maintenance areas and their signal line distribution outside
      the facility. Additional protection is recommended when commercial telephones
      are located in a RED electromagnetic environment. The most effective protection
      is provided by line disconnection switches and telephone line optical isolators
      that use waveguide below cutoff. The use of these devices or telephone filters
      must be approved by the CTTA. These devices should be considered only when
      installing. replacing or retrofitting telephone systems.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>4.9.1.1. TEMPEST Protective Measures.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>The separation
      recommendations of Section 3 apply. Remember that the administrative telephone
      system and its associated wiring are BLACK. The telephone system cabling
      should be routed in a separate distribution system. If filters or isolators
      are required and approved by the CTTA, the lines should be filtered/isolated
      where they egress the inspectable space or facility. Locating the
      filters/isolators at the controlled space is not recommended because the
      equipment TEMPEST zone may extend beyond the controlled space. In addition,
      fewer filters/,isolators will be necessary if the trunk lines rather than
      the individual phone lines are filtered/isolated.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>4.9.1.2. On-hook Security.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Telephone systems can exhibit
      insecurities even when the telephone instruments are on-hook. This happens
      when RED audio or acoustic signals impinge on microphonic components in the
      telephone. TSG 1 and TSG 2 provide guidance to prevent on-hook security problems.
      TSG 6 lists approved and type accepted telephone equipment.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>4.9.2. Paging, Intercom, and Public Address Systems.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>In
      addition to being a possible fortuitous conductor of TEMPEST emanations,
      the speakers in paging, intercom and public address systems can act as
      microphones and retransmit classified audio discussions out of the controlled
      area via the signal line distribution. This microphonic problem could also
      allow audio from higher classified areas to be heard from speakers in lesser
      classified areas. Ideally. such systems should not be used. Where deemed
      vital, the following precautions should be taken in full or in part to lessen
      the risk of the system becoming an escape medium for NSI.</FONT>

      <P>
      <B>4.9.3. Alarm Systems.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Many facilities employ alarm systems
      to detect and alert personnel of life threatening or security threatening
      situations. These systems employ passive or active sensors terminated on
      an annunciator panel. Such systems can also act as fortuitous</FONT> conductors
      and could require isolation filtering and separation treatment similar to
      telephone and intercom systems.
      <P>
      <B>4.9.4. Miscellaneous Fortuitous Conductors.</B> Building utilities and
      other support elements can become fortuitous conductors due to the use of
      metallic materials. Heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems air
      ducts, water pipes and gas pipes can require protection depending on their
      proximity to RED equipment and their distribution into uncontrolled areas.
      If conductors are identified as likely fortuitous conductors of TEMPEST signals
      into uncontrolled areas, the normal treatment is to insert a nonconductive
      section in the plumbing or duct work at the boundary of the inspectable space
      of the RED equipment. It is important to follow NEC, OSHA and any local building
      and fire codes when isolating various conductors. Some metallic distribution
      facilities must be electrically bonded to the building structure or the fault
      protection subsystem. Some materials can be prohibited in utilities such
      as sprinkler systems or pressurized systems. Life safety and compliance with
      all applicable building codes are an overriding concern when considering
      isolation of fortuitous conductors. For this reason and also due to the quantity
      and variety of potential fortuitous conductors throughout a facility, isolation
      of such conductors should be accomplished when practical. There are often
      alternative procedures to avoid TEMPEST conduction problems with such fortuitous
      conductors via relocation of equipment, or specific grounding of the fortuitous
      conductor.
      <P>
      <B>4.9.5. Radio Transmission or Reception Devices.</B> Any device that transmits
      or receives a radio signal is a potential security risk in a facility processing
      NSI. The risk is higher for radio transmission devices and in facilities
      using non-TEMPEST equipment. Traditional station designs place radio
      communications (combat net radio, microwave systems, etc.) away from the
      processing area. If not carefully controlled. other radio devices such as
      cellular telephones, cordless telephones, wireless local area networks (LANs)
      or portable satellite communications systems can be installed in a facility
      near RED equipment. Radio transmission equipment should be prohibited from
      all classified processing areas. If a mission requirement or space limitation
      demands that transmitters must be installed in classified processing areas,
      the separation recommendations of Section 3 must be met. For such installations,
      a CTTA review is required to evaluate the risks of TEMPEST vulnerabilities.
      Reception devices such as radios, television receivers, receive-only beepers
      can be installed if authorized by cognizant security authorities and if installed
      in compliance with the separation recommendations of Section 3.
      <P>
      <B>4.9.6. Commercial Television System Installation.</B> When commercial
      television systems are installed in secure areas, the CTTA should determine
      the countermeasures to prevent a video cable entering the secure area from
      conducting compromising emanations out of the secure area. The countermeasures
      depend on the type of cable used to bring the signal into the secure area.
      If an optical fiber cable is used at the entry point to the secure area,
      no additional countermeasure is required. If a metallic cable is used at
      the entry point, an amplifier/attenuator system may be required that should
      be located at the point where the cable enters the secure area. The type
      of amplifier/attenuator system used depends on the number of television receivers
      that will receive the video signal. For up to two television receivers, a
      video cassette recorder (VCR) can provide the video service and will also
      act as a "one way" filter. If a control box is used, it should be collocated
      with the VCR. The VCR should not be used for processing classified information
      unless the incoming video cable is disconnected. For more than two television
      receivers, an amplifier/attenuator system could be required to provide adequate
      signal level to the television receivers and to provide additional reverse
      isolation. An attenuator could be required if the amplified signal overdrives
      the television receivers. The attenuator will also provide additional reverse
      attenuation. Amplifiers that can amplify signals in both directions should
      not be used. Commercial television system equipment and cables should comply
      with the separation guidance in Section 3.
      <P>
      <B>4.10. Other Considerations</B>
      <P>
      <B>4.10.1 TEMPEST Zoning.</B> TEMPEST zoning is a countermeasure that takes
      advantage of free space propagation loss and the inherent shielding of a
      host facility. By profiling a structure's attenuation, TEMPEST zoning can
      allow equipment operation with less fear of unauthorized intercept and without
      the added expense of TEMPEST approved equipment or global shielding. The
      concept profiles the facility into zones that have varying levels of protection.
      This is determined by developing attenuation plots of radiated signals in
      four test bands between 10 MHz and 1,000 MHz compared with reference measurements
      taken with antennas separated by 20 meters in an open field environment.
      The TEMPEST zone profile data for a facility can then be used in conjunction
      with known TEMPEST zone characteristics of electronic equipment to enable
      selection and placement of equipment to contain radiated TEMPEST emanations
      within the predetermined secure areas of the facility. NSTISSAM TEMPEST/2-92
      contains details for TEMPEST zoning of facilities.
      <P>
      <B>4.10.2. Inspectable Space.</B> The inspectable space can vary considerably
      from one facility location to another. It is important to understand the
      boundaries of the inspectable space surrounding a facility to properly apply
      RED/BLACK countermeasures. The site designated TEMPEST approval authorities
      should define and a CTTA should approve the boundary.
      <P>
      <B>4.10.3. Facility Shielding.</B> In certain instances, systems processing
      NSI are so large and complex that application of TEMPEST protective measures
      to the equipment can be impossible or exorbitantly expensive. In such cases.
      the entire facility can be shielded and power, signal and utility penetrations
      of the shield treated to block and remove conducted CE. This approach should
      be implemented only after a thorough cost comparison analysis of alternative
      security countermeasures. Obtain guidance from a CTTA to determine requirements
      and recomm<FONT SIZE=3>ended methods for shielding. NSTISSAM TEMPEST/1-94
      contains details on shielding.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>4.10.4. TEMPEST Suppressed Equipment.</B> TEMPEST equipment have been
      tested in accordance with NSTISSAM TEMPEST/1-92 and demonstrated to comply
      with conducted and electromagnetic radiation limits of Level I, Level II
      or Level III.

      and their effects minimized. Secure voice systems should be isolated and
      source suppression fixes should be designed and incorporated by competent
      engineering and security authorities. System radiation and conduction levels
      that are in accordance with NSTISSAM TEMPEST/1-92 cannot be achieved through

      data or facsimile device. When used for secure voice communications only,
      no additional TEMPEST treatment is required. When a STU-III connects to a

      <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2></FONT>
      <P>
      <B>6.1. General.</B> This <FONT SIZE=3>appendix sets forth criteria to permit
      RED sensitive compartmented</FONT> information (SCI) and RED non-SCI to be
      processed through components of a single RED distribution system. Where the
      sharing of a single system is feasible, considerable cost savings can be
      realized. In some cases, the savings will permit wider application of secure
      voice and other services that otherwise could not be achieved if separate
      systems were required. In order to preclude unintentional compromise of SCI
      in shared systems, the constraints contained in this appendix take precedence
      over other recommendations. For most cases, the measures prescribed are
      sufficient to prevent unintentional misrouting of SCI into non-SCI channels
      and to limit SCI crosstalk into non-SCI circuits to levels that are
      nondiscernible except by a &nbsp;deliberate instrumented attack. An instrumented
      attack to exploit SCI crosstalk or other SCI radiated or conducted emanations
      present in U.S. controlled, non-SCI areas is viewed as unlikely, because
      only U.S. cleared individuals would have the access to mount such an attack.
      In most cases, the risk is considered acceptable, but where the cognizant
      SCI approval authority (Director of Central Intelligence Agency, Director
      of the National Security Agency, or Director of the Defense Intelligence
      Agency, as appropriate) deems necessary, additional requirements for safeguarding
      of SCI may be imposed with CTTA validation of the additional countermeasures.
      In some cases, the requirements of this appendix may be too restrictive and
      may be waived by the above authorities to allow both SCI and non-SCI under
      their cognizance to be processed over a single RED system.
      <P>
      NOTE: <I>The Director of Central Intelligence provides guidance on physical
      security for SCI facilities in DCID 1/21.</I>
      <P>
      <B>6.2. Routing of SCI Cables.</B> All <FONT SIZE=3>SCI cables should be
      contained totally within the SCI areas unless installed in a protected
      distribution system (PDS) approved by the cognizant CTTA.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>6.3. Termination Boxes.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Separate dedicated termination
      boxes must be used for SCI circuits. These boxes are for convenience in
      interfacing the SCI signal cable to the terminal equipment and should be
      located close to the equipment. SCI termination boxes must be within SCI
      areas.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>6.4. Distribution Frame.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Separate dedicated distribution
      frames (any cabinet or box containing terminal blocks for cable cross connects
      or interconnects) must be used for SCI circuits. A common SCI/non-SCI enclosure
      (cabinet, box. etc.) may be used, but a rigid partition must physically separate
      the SCI and non-SCI areas to preclude inadvertent cross connects or interconnects
      of SCI to non-SCI circuits. The SCI area must be conspicuously labeled
      <B>"Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI)." </B>No matter that enclosure
      is selected. shields of SCI and non-SCI cables must not be tied back or
      disconnected upon entering a frame, but must continue into their respective
      areas to reduce the possibility of crosstalk between unshielded conductors.
      Similarly, SCI and non-SCI cross connects and interconnects must never be
      grouped together. If two enclosures are used, each with SCI and non-SCI areas,
      SCI cross connects and interconnects between the enclosures must be via separate
      conduit or separate overall shield so that separation and isolation from
      non-SCI circuits is maintained.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>6.5. Patch Panels.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Separate dedicated patch panels must
      be used for unencrypted SCI circuits and encrypted SCI circuits. SCI patch
      panels should be uniquely wired, using different styled jacks and plugs,
      or be sufficiently separated from other patch panels to preclude inadvertently
      cross patching SCI circuits to non-SCI (encrypted) circuits. SCI patch panels
      must be within</FONT> SCI areas, or under <FONT SIZE=3>combination lock if
      outside SCI areas, with lock combination available only to SCI-cleared
      personnel.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>6.6. Multiplexers, Video and Audio Switches, and Other Multiple Circuit
      Equipment.</B> Multiplexers, video switches, audio switches and other multiple
      circuit equipments associated with RED unencrypted signal lines may be used
      to process both SCI and <FONT SIZE=3>non-SCI, subject to the following
      conditions:</FONT>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>a. Plain Text Transmission.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>The probability of inadvertent
	plain text transmission of SCI to a non-SCI user due to channel slippage
	or other causes shall be no greater than one per million.</FONT>
	<P>
	<B>b. Unwanted Third Party Connection.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>The probability of
	an unwanted third party connection to an SCI circuit shall be no greater
	than one per million.</FONT>
	<P>
	<B>c. Crosstalk.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Crosstalk levels between any channels within
	an equipment, to include those likely to yield worst case conditions (e.g.,
	adjacent conductors or paths in the same cable, on the same printed circuit
	board, through the same integrated circuit component, etc.), shall meet the
	applicable standards below:</FONT>
	<P>
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    65 dB minimum audio crosstalk isolation at any frequency between 0.3 and
	    15 kHz.
	</UL>
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    60 dB minimum video crosstalk isolation at any frequency up to 5 MHz with
	    <FONT SIZE=3>nonsynchronous sources.</FONT>
	</UL>
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    30 dB minimum baseband digital crosstalk isolation. Baseband is defined as
	    the frequency range from the digital rate (R<SUB>d</SUB>) <I><FONT SIZE=2>
	    </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=3>to 10</FONT>R<SUB>d</SUB>.
	</UL>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>
      <B>6.7. Access Points.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Access to all points with breakouts
      of the SCI circuits must be restricted to SCI-cleared personnel. Access points
      containing SCI and non-SCI circuits that do not have breakouts of the SCI
      circuits can be serviced by non-SCI personnel, if escorted by appropriately
      cleared SCI personnel. These requirements apply both within SCI areas and
      for protected signal distribution systems external to SCI areas.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>6.8. Cables.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Separate dedicated cables must be used for
      SCI circuits, e.g., all conductors within the overall sheath of a cable carrying
      SCI can be used only for SCI circuits. All metallic cables installed in the
      signal distribution system must have, as a minimum, one overall nonferrous
      shield, with the exception that applications requiring coaxial cable must
      use a cable having a separate insulated shield, e.g., twinaxial or triaxial
      (preferably twinaxial for data rates up to 1 MHz and triaxial for data rates
      above 1 MHz). Section 3 and Section 4, paragraph 4.4. provide additional
      signal line guidance including use of optical fiber cables.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>6.9. Low-level Signaling.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>A design objective of the signal
      distribution system is that all digital signals comply with the low-level
      criteria in MIL-STD-188-114. Exceptions must be evaluated and approved on
      a case-by-case basis by the appropriate accrediting CTTA.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>6.10. Power and Signal Line Filtering. </B><FONT SIZE=3>The accrediting
      CTTA should determine the requirement for power and signal line
      filtering.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>6.11. Standard Service Features. </B><FONT SIZE=3>Generally, SCI systems
      should use the standard service features of the overall facility used for
      secure non-SCI systems such as power, ground systems, etc.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>6.12. Telephone Lines. </B><FONT SIZE=3>The accrediting authority should
      determine, on a case-by-case basis, the need for filtering or optical isolation
      at the point of entry all telephone lines entering an SCI facility containing
      equipment (TEMPEST approved or not approved) that process SCI data. If the
      telephone lines have been filtered or optically isolated at the boundary
      of a lesser classified area prior to entry to the SCI facility, the requirement
      for additional filters or isolators at the SCI facility boundary should be
      evaluated by appropriate accrediting CTTA.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>6.13. RED/BLACK Separation. </B><FONT SIZE=3>The RED/BLACK separation
      recommendations in Section 3 apply for systems processing SCI data.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>6.14. Additional Requirements. </B><FONT SIZE=3>Contact the cognizant
      SCI approval CTTA to ascertain whether additional RED/BLACK and TEMPEST measures
      are required for facilities processing SCI.</FONT>

      <B>7.2.1 Fixed Operation.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Transportable systems operated
      at a fixed location for sixty or more days shall be installed according to
      Recommendation I of Table 3- 1. In addition, the following recommendations
      apply.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>7.2.1.1. RED Cables.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>RED wire cables shall be shielded
      and insulated overall.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>7.2.1.2. Separation.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>RED processors should be separated
      by one meter from any BLACK equipment with wire lines that exit the inspectable
      space or are connected to an RF transmitter. If the separation cannot be
      maintained, the CTTA must conduct a review to determine whether filters or
      other countermeasures should be recommended. For existing facilities the
      CTTA could request TEMPEST/NONSTOP tests be performed to determine needed
      countermeasures.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>7.2.1.3. CTTA Review.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Vulnerabilities introduced by operating
      in a tactical environment could affect the requirements for inspectable space

      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>
      <B>7.3. Deploying Equipment Away from Transportables.</B> When
      <FONT SIZE=3>deploying equipment to tents or buildings, any shielding provided
      by the transportable is lost. Field expedient installations may create TEMPEST
      vulnerabilities. Buildings could have many fortuitous conductors (visible
      or hidden) that can conduct signals beyond the inspectable space. If such
      an installation is to be in place for sixty or more days, the CTTA should
      determine whether any fixed facility installation procedures should be
      applied.</FONT>

      <B>8.1. General.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>The primary TEMPEST vulnerability of aircraft
      systems (fixed wing, rotary wing, remote pilotless vehicle) is NONSTOP. This
      appendix provides guidance to protect against this vulnerability.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>8.2. Aircraft Installations.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Aircraft installation
      vulnerabilities can be associated in two categories: airborne operations
      and ramp operations. The applications of TEMPEST design and countermeasures
      must consider weight, size, power consumption, </FONT>cooling
      <FONT SIZE=3>requirements and available space.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>8.2.1. Airborne Operations.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Aircraft systems will be
      installed according to Recommendation I of Table 3-1. In addition, the following
      recommendations apply.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>8.2.1.1.</B> RED Cables. <FONT SIZE=3>RED wire cables shall be shielded
      and insulated overall.</FONT>

      <P>
      <B>8.2.1.3. Grounding.</B> <FONT SIZE=3>Grounding onboard an aircraft is
      critical. While it may appear that the skin and structure of the aircraft
      provides an equipotential plane, empirical data shows that many current paths
      exist because of seams, material used and static buildup during flight. In
      addition, the aircraft structure provides power return, protective ground
      and signal grounds. These conditions must be considered when designing the
      grounding scheme. The following guidance supersedes Section 4.</FONT>
      <P>
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Protective ground systems should be installed according to MIL-HDBK-419.
      </UL>
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  <FONT SIZE=3>There should be separate RED and BLACK ground systems. All ground
	  systems should be separated from each other according to the recommendations
	  in Section 3 and connected directly to the aircraft structure. A signal ground
	  should be established at each component level requiring such a return path.

      <B>8.2.2. Ramp Operations.</B> All <FONT SIZE=3>of the guidance for airborne
      operations apply for ramp operations. Vulnerabilities introduced by operating
      in this environment could affect the requirements for inspectable space
      definition, power source restrictions and grounding procedures and should
      be reviewed by the CTTA. The CTTA could request TEMPEST/NONSTOP be performed

      can be associated in two categories: underway (at sea) and in port.
      <P>
      <B>9.2.1. Underway Operations.</B> Shipboard systems will <FONT SIZE=3>be
      installed according to Recommendation I of Table 3- . In addition, the following
      recommendations apply.</FONT>
      <P>
      <B>9.2.1.1. RED Cables.</B> RED wire cables shall be shielded and insulated
      overall.
      <P>
      <B>9.2.1.2. Separation.</B> RED processors shall be separated by one meter
      from any BLACK equipment with wire lines that exit the inspectable space
      or are connected to an RF transmitter. If the separation cannot be maintained,
      the CTTA must conduct a review to determine whether filters or other
      countermeasures should be recommended. For existing facilities, the CTTA
      could request TEMPEST/NONSTOP tests be performed to determine needed
      countermeasures.
      <P>
      <B>9.2.1.3. Shielded Cables.</B> Shielded cables must meet the applicable
      requirements of MIL-C- 17, MIL-C-915. MIL-C-24640, or MIL-C-24643.
      <P>
      <B>9.2.1.4. RED Ground.</B> RED equipment must be bonded to ground according
      to MIL-STD-1310.
      <P>
      <B>9.2.1.5. Cryptographic Equipment Ground.</B> Cryptographic equipment must
      be bonded according to installation control drawings. In the absence of
      installation control drawings, bond according to MIL-STD-1310.
      <P>
      <B>9.2.1.6. Cable Distribution.</B> Cables may contain conductors connected
      to both a RED distribution system and a BLACK distribution system provided
      the RED conductors are either shielded individually or overall and separately
      from the BLACK conductors. This guidance supersedes Recommendation I, paragraph
      2, Note 2 of Section 3.
      <P>
      <B>9.2.2. In Port Operations.</B> All shipboard systems shall be designed
      to comply with the requirements for underway operations as approved by the
      CTTA. Vulnerabilities introduced by operating in this environment could affect
      the requirements for inspectable space definition, power source restrictions,
      land line connections, etc., and should be reviewed by the CTTA. The CTTA
      could request TEMPEST/NONSTOP be performed to determine needed countermeasures.
      <P>
      <B>9.2.3. Physical Security.</B> The management of inspectable space and
      the control of conductors leaving the inspectable space must be incorporated
      in the port physical security plan.
