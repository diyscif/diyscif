experienced, technically qualified U.S. government employee who has
met established certification requirements in accordance with
NSTISSC-approved criteria and has been appointed by a U.S
Government Department or Agency to fulfill CTTA responsibl-lities.

        b.  (U) Inspectable Space - The three-dimensional space
surrounding equipment that process classified and/or sensiltfve
information within which TEMPEST exploitation is not considered
practical or where legal authority to identify and/or remove a
potential TEMPEST exploitation exists.

                      <b><u>SECTION V - REQUIREMENTS</u></b>


       8.  (U)  This instruction establishes the requirement to
review the Tempest posture of certain facILITIES where national
security information is processed. A CTTA must conduct or validate
all TEMPEST countermeasure reviews required by this instruction.
However, the requirement for the CTTA to conduct or validate such
review does not necessarily imply the need to implement TEMPEST
countermeasures.  When the CTTA identifies the need to implement
TEMPEST countermeasures at a specific facility, the CTTA will
recommend the most cost effective countermeasure which will contain
compromising emanations within the inspectable space to the
decision authority designated by the department/agency head.

       9.  (U)  Outside the United States:

            a.  (<strike>C</strike>)  Facilities located in a <u>High Threat Environment</u>
require the highest security protection levels of TEMPEST
countermeasures.  <font color="Red">Equipment processing information at levels of</font>
<font color="Red">UNCLASSIFIED through TOP SECRET will be reviewed.</font>

requirements:

           a.  Completion of three continuous years of TEMPEST
technical experience, including at least one year's experience in
evaluating TEMPEST vulnerabilities of operational facilities and
making recommendations on TEMPEST countermeasures.

           b.  Completion of mandatory NSTISSC-approved training on
the technical threat and the CTTA TE14PEST Countermeasures
Application Course.

           c.  Completion of NSTISSC-approved technical training.
Technical training requirements may be waived by department or
agency heads, in consultation with the National Manager.

     13.  (U)  The CTTA shall determine the Inspectable Space for a
facility.

     14.  (U)  The CTTA shall maintain a record of all TEMPEST
countermeasure reviews conducted, recommendations provided and
estimated cost of implementation.

                   <b><u>TEMPEST COUNTERMEASURE REVIEW</u></b>


     (U)  In conducting TEMPEST countermeasure reviews, the CTTA
shall, as a minimum, evaluate the following factors.

         1.  (<strike>C</strike>)  Location - xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxx <font color="Red">systems and the proximity to the establishments</font>
xxxxxxx <font color="Red">of countries on the National Security Threat List (NSTL)</font>
<font color="Red">and other countries that could pose a technical threat to the </font>
<font color="Red">information being processed. </font>

         2.  (U)  Volume of Information Processed - Consider the
percentage and volume of information processed at the UNCLASSIFIED,
SENSITIVE, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET and TOP SECRET level.  Determine
the number of pages, messages, screens, etc. for each of the above
classification levels.

         3.  (U)  Sensitivity of Information Processed - Consider
the sensitivity of the information being processed by the equipment
and facility (e.g., DOE - Restricted Data; DCI - Sensitive
Compartmented Information (SCI); Joint Staff - SIOP).  This will
be useful in determining the likelihood that an adversary may
target the facility.

         4.  (U)  Perishability of Information Processed - Consider
if the information being processed is of long term value (e.g.
strategic) or short term value (e.g. tactical).

         5.  (U)  Physical Control - Consider the physical/access
control over the facility and areas containing the system under
review.  This includes guards (number, hours of posting, patrols,
etc.); badging; control over access to facility; alarms; procedures
to monitor/control uncleared or unauthcrized personnel including
char force, vending personnel, and telephone/power
maintainers/installers.  Determine the level of authority which
exists for the inspection or removal of personnel who could
potentially exploit TEMPEST vulnerabilities.  Examine the posting
of warning signs and the implementation of procedures in effect to
exercise control over parking and other areas adjacent to or in
close proximity to the facility/system under review.

         6.  (U) TEMPEST Profile of Equipment - Consider generic
or actual TEMPEST profile information for each equipment/system
used to process classified information at the facility.  Consider
existing on-site TEMPEST test results for the facility.

MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION

SUBJECT: Annex C to NSTISSI No. 7000 - ACTION MEMORANDUM

      1. During the development of NSTISSI No. 7000, TEMPEST Countermea-
sures for Facilities, dated 29 November 1993, the TEMPEST Advisory Group
(TAG) agreed that the reference to the FBI's National Security Threat List [see <a href="d:\0-a-htm\nstissi-7000.htm" #nstl="">below</a>] 
(NSTL) should be replaced with a list based specifically on the ability and 
motivation of a foreign government to conduct a TEMPEST attack against the 
U.S. Government. The FBI's NSTL was the best source at that time, but was
developed without consideration of a country's TEMPEST capabilities. Since 
the ratification of the national policy, the NSA INFOSEC Threat Office has
researched the TEMPEST threat posed by foreign governments and developed a
list of countries that have demonstrated hostile intentions toward U.S. 
interests and are known to exploit compromising emanations.

      2. In accordance with the National Manager's responsibilities under
NSTISSP No. 300 to publish an annual assessment of the domestic and foreign
TEMPEST threat, the TAG has prepared the enclosed annex, enumerating those
countries, to be issued to all holders of NSTISSI No. 7000 as a replacement 
for all references to the FBI's NSTL. Also enclosed are the pen and ink changes
required in NSTISSI No. 7000 to implement the new annex.

      3. If additional information or assistance is required, the Secretariat
point of contact for this action is Pat Griffith, who can be reached at 
(410) 859-6805.
