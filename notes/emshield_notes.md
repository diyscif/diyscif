# Notes on [EMshield Aktiver Abh√∂rschutz](../sources/EMshield_Germany_ActiveEavesdroppingProtection.pdf)

Soundproofing in room architecture alternative or supplemental to active cancelling.

Noise generation system prevents conversation monitoring using laser systems or structure-borne microphones

Laser protection film on windows against penetrating laser beams.

Transducer installed on panes, in walls and ceiling and on pipes

Randomly generated noise waves of conversation superimposed

Intelligent test receivers (radio receivers/spectrum analyzers): Detect and analyze infrared signals from air and long wave signals from power lines

Semiconductor detector or non-linear-junction detector (NLJD): Passive transmitters and semiconductor components such as eavesdropping devices that are not currently transmitting or switched-off mobile phones

TALAN line analyzer: Check network, telephone and power lines, detection of eavesdroppers on lines with frequency domain reflectometer measurement
