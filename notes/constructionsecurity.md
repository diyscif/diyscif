# Notes on Construction Security

## Construction Security Requirements

For renovation, barriers installed to segregate construction workers from operational activities. Protection against unauthorized access and visual observation.

When expanding SCIF space into uncontrolled areas, maximum demolition required.

Construction personel
* Not from SETL critical countries
* U.S. citizens and U.S. firms preferably
* Finish work in Category III countries by SECRET-cleared U.S. personnel
* Non-cleared construction personnel shall provide the SSM with biographical data (full name, current address, Social Security Number (SSN), date and place of birth (DPOB), proof of citizenship, etc.), and fingerprint cards
  * checks of criminal and subversive files, local, national, and host country agency files, through liaison channels
  * CIA indices checks through country's DNI representative and appropriate in-theater U.S. military authorities
* Access to sites denied or withdrawn if adverse security, Counterintelligence (CI), or criminal activity is revealed
* For new facilities
  * Non-cleared workers, monitored by CSTs, may perform the installation of major utilities and feeder lines
  * Installation observed at perimeter entry points and when any trenches are being filled
  * Number of CSTS determined by size of project
* For existing facilities
  * Non-cleared workers, monitored by CSTs or cleared escorts, may perform maximum demolition and debris removal
  * TOP SECRET-cleared workers shall be used to renovate or construct SCIF space
  * SECRET-cleared individuals may perform the work when escorted by TOP SECRET-cleared personnel
  * SCI-indoctrinated escorts not required when existing SCIF has been sanitized or barrier has been constructed to separate the operational areas from the areas identified for construction
* All construction personnel shall receive security briefing
* If a construction worker leaves the project under unusual circumstances, the SSM shall document the occurrence and notify

Access Control of Construction Sites
* Access control and badges required
* Guards required outside U.S.
* Possible measures should be considered
  * Identity verification
  * Random searches
  * Signs listing prohibited items
  * Physical barriers
  * Vehicle inspections
* Guards
  * Local, supervised guards may search all non-cleared personnel, bags, toolboxes, packages
  * In Category I countries, CAGs shall be assigned to protect the site and surrounding area
  * A SECRET-cleared, U.S. citizen must supervise any non-cleared or non-U.S. guards. Non-cleared or non-U.S. guards shall not have unescorted access to the site.

## Construction Materials

For projects in Category III countries, cleared U.S. citizens may randomly select up to 35% of building materials from _non-specific general construction materials_ for SCIF construction. In category I and II countries, up to 25 %.

Procurement of materials from host or third party countries identified in the SETL as critical for technical intelligence or listed in the DoS Prohibited Countries Matrix is prohibited.

Inspectable materials
* May be procured from U.S. suppliers without security restriction
* If procured in host and third party countries, or shipped to site in unsecured manner shall be inspected using approved method and then moved to SSA
* Random selection of material stored outside of SSA shall be inspected using approved methods

Non-inspectable materials
* May be procured from U.S. suppliers or other approved channels and securely transported to SSA
* May be procured in host or third party country if randomly selected by U.S. citizens with security clearance
* Materials shall be randomly chosen from suppliers' shelf-stock without advance notice or intended use
* Don't establish discernible patterns when purchasing

## Secure Transportation for Construction Material

Inspectable materials
* Secure transportation not required, materials shall be inspected using approved procedures
* Shall be stored in SSA
* If securely procured, shipped and stored inspectable materials may be utilized without inspection

Non-Inspectable materials (include inspectable materials when approved procedures not possible)
* Shall be securely procured, and shipped from US, secure logistics facility or low threat third party country using one of following methods
  * Securely packaged or containerized and under the 24-hour control of an approved courier or escort office
  * Securely shipped using approved transit security technical safeguards capable of detecting evidence of tampering or compromise.
  * U.S. Military, U.S. Flag Carriers, Foreign Flag Carriers (in order of preference)

## Secure Storage of Construction Material

SSA: True floor to true ceiling, slab-to-slab construction of some substantial material, and a solid wood-core or steel-clad door equipped with an AO-approved security lock

All inspected and securely shipped materials placed in SSA upon arrival and stored there until required for installation

Alternatively
* Shipping container located within a secure perimeter that is locked, alarmed, and monitored.
* Room or outside location enclosed by a secure perimeter that is under direct observation by a SECRET-cleared U.S. citizen

Under control of CAGs or other U.S. personnel holding at least U.S. SECRET clearances

## Technical Security

TEMPEST countermeasures shall be pre-engineered into the construction of the SCIF.

TSCM inspection
* Required for new SCIF, significant renovations in Category I
* May be required in Category II and III
* Always required if uncontrolled space is converted to new SCIF space.

## Concept

1. Anonymously procured materials
2. Inspection procedures for inspectable material
3. Secure transportation
4. Secure storage
5. Guards, controlled entry, background checked/trusted personnel

## [Inspectable Materials](../sources/DNI_USA_InspectableMaterialsChecklist.pdf)

Inspections Methods
* [X-Ray](https://www.labtesting.com/services/nondestructive-testing/x-ray-inspection/): ca. $ 100000
  * Product: https://metrixndt.com/systems/osprey-160-2/
* [Ultrasonic](https://www.labtesting.com/services/nondestructive-testing/ultrasonic-testing/): ca. $ 10000
  * Product: https://www.olympus-ims.com/de/ut-flaw/
* Visual
* Metal detector
* Destructive test

Foundation Materials (Water, Cement, Rebar, etc.)
* Aggregate cement, sand and gravel should be poured through an appropriate sized mesh
* Magnet should be utilized to occasionally check for inappropriate metallic particles
* At least 10% of the rebar should be examined for internal voids using ultrasonic testing (destructive test is ultrasonic tester is unavailable)

Masonry (Cement blocks, bricks, stone work, etc.)
* Precast is not acceptable if created off site unless constructed in the US and shipped secure (iff CST inspects the precast as it is made, it is acceptable)
* Stonework for fa√ßade needs only visual inspection
* Internal stone work must undergo a 3% random destruction test
* Scaffolding should be inspected internally before allowed on site

Tools and Fasteners (Tool boxes, welding rod, fasteners, etc.)
* Personal tool boxes will be examined when first brought on site, and randomly thereafter
* They will be locked on the site when not in use and workers will not be allowed to carry them on and off the site

Metal Items (Structural Steel, Metal Decking, Metal Fabrications, etc.)
* Visual inspection applies only to common, commercially available items
* Items requiring special fabrication are not inspectable unless CST is present during fabrication

Carpentry and Furniture (Lumber, Rough & finished carpentry, Furniture w/out electrical raceway)
* Finished and rough carpentry items constructed on site will be monitored by CSTs
* Furniture having built in electrical devices or lamps must be disassembled and inspected separately

Thermal Moisture Protection (Water-proof membrane, thermal insulation, bituminous water proofing, etc.)
* Metallic membranes preferred as they offer some degree of RF attenuation

Doors and Windows excluding locks (Metal Doors, Glazing, Vault Doors, etc.)

Finishes (Gypsum Wallboard, Raised Flooring, Ceramic Tile, etc.)
* Bundles of tiles will be unpacked and no more than two tiles at a time will be examined

Plumbing and Mechanical Systems (Plumbing, plumbing fixtures, prefabricated ducts, etc.)
* Can be inspected if no tape, insulation and/or other finishes have been used

Electrical Items (Wire, Conduit, light bulbs, etc.)

Other Miscellaneous (Chalk & tack boards, fire extinguishers, locks, etc.)
