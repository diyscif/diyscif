## Chapter 6: Sound insulation of drywall and lightweight constructions

Definition of terms

### Acoustical behavior of double-shell building components

In massive walls easy formula: More mass means more sound attenuation

Using drywall one can construct a highly effective separating wallwith a fraction of the mass.

Rules for good sound attenuation of double shell components
* Flexurally soft shells with simultaneously high surface-related mass: Gypsum fiberboard, plasterboard, wood-based panels up to approx. 20 mm, the higher the mass per area of the soft facing-shell the higher the sound-insulating effect.
* Decoupling of the connection between the shells: Connection as decoupled as possible (e.g. soft, springy) or, ideally, completely separate.
* High degree of cavity filling with sound-absorbing insulation materials: Airborne sound waves lose energy as they pass through the fibers
* Component connections: Tight, no sound bridges (e.g. connection via insulation strips)

### Longitudinal sound transmission

Longitudinal sound transmission via adjacent "flanking" components

Longitudinal sound transmission is especially bad in lightweight partition walls with flanking solid walls. Articulated connection doesn't contribute to sound insulation, no joint insulation.

#### Rigid connections

Joint insulation takes place when massive wall connects to massive wall. Only present in exclusive massive construction.

#### Articulated connections

Occurs, for example, in skeleton or solid buildings with light finishing, as well as in wood constructions.

Separating and flanking component practically independent

The longitudinal insulation is not affected by the acoustic properties of the partition wall

Lightweight partition wall - flanking solid wall: flanking solid components of sufficient mass so that longitudinal sound insulation can be ensured

Lightweight partition wall - flanking lightweight wall: Longitudinal sound conduction of a flexible flanking component is low in this case; with appropriate design, hardly any sound energy is transmitted. According to DIN 4109-1, the longitudinal sound insulation values are between 53 and 75 dB.

Two options
* Transmission via the cladding
* Transmission via the cavity

Measures
* To minimize the transmission of sound waves in the cavity, the cavity is damped with fiber insulation material or partitioned off in the connection area of the separating component.
* Sound transmission via the wall shell is influenced by the structure of the wall shell. A higher mass has a positive effect. Longitudinal sound transmission via double cladding is lower than via single clad walls
* The most effective method, however, is to separate the flanking wall shell in the connection area to the separating component. No continuous planking between two adjacent rooms

Calculation of system attenuation: DIN 4109, Supplement 1, the BAKT publication "553", the "Trockenbau-Atlas" or calculation sheets from system providers

In lightweight construction, the weighted sound reduction index Rw,R of the separating component (e.g. room partition) and the individual longitudinal sound reduction indexes RL,w,R of the flanking components (e.g. corridor wall, facade, ceiling, floor) must be known in order to determine the resulting sound insulation.

### Examples

New York Silent House: The partition walls were designed as metal stud walls based on the principle of double-shell walls with an additional free-standing facing-shell. Due to the asymmetrical design, resonances and undesired sound penetrations were avoided. The sound reduction index determined in the test rig without flanking transmission was Rw,p = 85 dB, while the resulting airborne sound reduction index R'w of the apartment partition wall in the building was 71 dB.
