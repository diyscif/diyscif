# Notes on [DoD_USA_UFC](../sources/DoD_USA_UFC.pdf)

Mainly underlying information summarized by [NAVFAC_USA_PhysicalSecurity](../sources/NAVFAC_USA_PhysicalSecurity.pdf)

## CCTV

Cameras are not allowed within the SCIF perimeter. A camera may be provided on exterior of SCIF for monitoring of a entrance. Shall be monitored/operated by SCI-indoctrinated personnel within the SCIF.

## RF Mitigation

SCIF perimeter wall may have foil backed gypsum wall board or R-foil.

Foil layer shall be placed inside the SCIF between the first and second layer of GWB. 

RF mitigation shall be provided for walls, ceilings, floors, and all penetrations including doors and windows.

Doors shall be steel with RF gasket, and door frame shall be bonded to RF shield. Shielding shall be electrically bonded
continuously at interfaces between, walls, floors, ceilings, doors, and windows.

RF mitigation may include waveguides, power line and telecommunication line filters.

Mounting apparatus shall not be connected to the RF shielding material in a manner that affects RF shielding performance.

## Paging, Intercom, and Public Address Systems

Systems should be totally contained within the SCIF.

If not, for eavesdropping (using the speakers as microphones), a buffer amplifier is the standard mitigation.
* For most systems, this is a simple amplifier in SCIF that takes the incoming audio signal and amplifies/distributes the signal to the speakers within the SCIF.

In systems that require two-way communication, the system shall have electronic isolation. SCIF occupants must be alerted when the system is activated.

Provide voice frequency, lowpass filters if they are not totally contained within the Inspectable space. This protects against TEMPEST signals on the cables but does not protect against voice modulation of the speakers.

When required, all electronic isolation components shall be installed within the SCIF as near to the point of SCIF penetration as possible.
