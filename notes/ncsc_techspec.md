# Notes on [NCSC_USA_TechnicalSpecifications](../sources/NCSC_USA_TechnicalSpecifications.pdf)

## Purpose

Facilitate the protection of Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) against compromising emanations, inadvertent observation and disclosure by unauthorized persons, and the detection of unauthorized entry

## Analytical Risk Management Process

SCIFs include fixed facilities, mobile platforms, prefabricated structures, containers, modular applications or other new or emerging applications

Risk management process includes a critical evaluation of threats, vulnerability, and assets to determine the need and value of countermeasures
* Threat Analysis
* Vulnerability Analysis
* Probability Analysis
* Consequence Analysis

## Security In Depth

Describes the factors that enhance the probability of detection before actual penetration to the SCIF occurs

Layers may, alter construction requirements and extend security alarm response time to the maximum of 15 minutes

Primary means (at least one must be applied)
* Military installations, embassy compounds, U.S. Government (USG) compounds, or contractor compounds with dedicated response force of U.S. persons
* Controlled buildings with separate building access controls, required to gain access to the buildings or elevators
* Controlled office areas adjacent to or surrounding SCIFs
* Fenced compounds with access controlled vehicle gate and/or pedestrian gate
* Additional custom strategies

## Compartmented Area

A CA is an area, room, or a set of rooms within a SCIF that provides controlled separation

Access control to the CA may be accomplished by visual recognition or mechanical/electronic access control devices. Spin-dial combination locks shall not be installed on CA doors. Independent alarm systems shall not be installed in a CA.

Shoulder surfing countermeasures inside CA: Position the computer screen away from doorway/cubicle opening, polarizing privacy screen, partitions and/or signs, existing private offices or rooms

Closed Storage: Access and visual controls identified above shall be the standard safeguard, Compartmented information shall be physically stored in a GSA approved safe

Open Storage (rare): If the parent SCIF is accredited for open storage, a private office with access control on the door is adequate physical security protection. If the parent SCIF has been built and accredited for closed storage, then the CA perimeter shall be constructed and accredited to open storage standards.

Acoustic and Technical Security: All TEMPEST, administrative telephone, and technical surveillance countermeasure (TSCM) requirements for the parent SCIF shall apply to the CA. When compartmented discussions are required, use existing rooms that have been accredited for SCI discussions or restrict access to the room during conversations

## Perimeter Wall Construction Criteria
