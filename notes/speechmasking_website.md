# Notes on [speechmasking.com](https://speechmasking.com)

Walls: Emitters at specific intervals to provide uniform protection along the length of all perimeter walls using Stud-Mount Emitter Bracket
Windows: Emitters on the window frame or on the window itself as countermeasure to laser microphone and remote laser eavesdropping
Ducts: All ducts and housings which pass through perimeter acoustically protected to ensure speech does not transfer out
Pipes: All pipes and conduit which enter or egress secure space can transfer audio and should be treated with speech masking
Raised floors: Filling open space under a raised floor with SpeechMask energy from volumetric speaker reduces possibility of audio compromise
Drop ceilings: Open spaces above drop ceiling are acoustical vulnerability. Properly spaced volumetric speaker aiming outward are necessary.
Doors: Doors are secured with SpeechMask emitters placed directly on the frame and around the door to provide uniform audio mask

## Technology

3 levels
1. SpeechMask® algorithm: lower-cost method to implement a high-quality, speech-based sound mask ideal for most corporate customers. Layers of speech mixing and randomizing techniques are used to create a unique and highly effective mask
2. M2 algorithm: highly advanced speech-masking process using a natural-sounding voice spectrum for maximum effectiveness. Masking voices can be preloaded, or they can be sampled from the actual persons assigned to the room. The M2 algorithm is normally used to protect classified conversations taking place in cleared contractor facilities.
3. Further. Custom contact.

Soundmasking vs. SpeechMasking
* Unless they are used at uncomfortably loud levels, pink and white noises are not effective at masking the human voice
* To effectively mask the human voice using a white noise generator, the power level from a white noise generator needs to be two to five times higher than the voice trying to be masked.
* Broadband noises such a pink, white, and common digital soundmasking generators do not replicate or represent the human vocal system and can be filtered out by sophisticated speech extraction software.
* Human speech is primarily composed of energy having tonal characteristics (vowels) and other sounds with disruptive consonant characteristics (unvoiced plosives and fricatives). The turbulent airstream of voiced fricatives creates a chaotic mix of random frequencies that are completely different than those made by randomized white and pink noise generators. The sound of rushing water or a gentle hissing noise does nothing to effectively reduce intelligibility in the near field.
* Intelligibility tends to drop rapidly when speech become reverberant
* At least 26 factors that affect intelligibility, each factor must be accounted for in the process
* Most important is how the mask is applied and directed inside the office space
* In a properly designed speech-masking system, occupants do not hear — or only faintly hear — the mask inside the room
* Only way to listen to the mask is by listening directly against the outside wall

Masking of speech depends on three characteristics of the masking sound. Its
1. Intensity relative to the intensity of the speech
2. Acoustic spectrum
3. Temporal continuity

##  Factors

Factors Affecting STC Ratings
* System Integration: Are elements installed to manufacturer specifications and do they integrate with surrounding elements
* Material Selection: Layering technique, wall transfer function, how it's affixed, and how the wall is built
* Stud Type and Spacing: Acoustical energy can couple through wall studs
* Type of Insulation: Amount and type of insulation used inside the wall can vary in terms of quality, density and noise reduction rating
* Flanking Paths: Air gaps, spaces, or other paths that allow audio generated inside a room to escape
* Wall Penetrations: Various holes and cutouts negatively affect the STC rating of the walls
* Door Installation: Door frame must be properly attached and sealed to the wall
* Installation Errors: Drywall not aligned, unforeseen gaps between structural studs and standard studs, structural pillar in perimeter wall, top door header, architectural decoration
* True Floor/True Ceiling: Problem with ribbed profile deck between ribs


Speech Transmission Index (STI): measure of intelligibility whose value varies from 0 (completely unintelligible) to 1 (perfect intelligibility). International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard 60268-16.

Factors Affecting Speech Privacy
* Speaker Density and Placement: Different wall types dicate different optimum speaker density and spacing
* Speaker Selection: Speaker must be capable of delivering the proper amount of wattage, bandwidth, and dynamic range
* Power Delivery and Amplitude Adjustments: Speakers must be individually controlled. Each segment or section of a wall can react differently to sound stimuli. Abnormal acoustical amplitude variations may be detected in improperly adjusted system.
* Spectrum Adjustments: Generated audio spectrum must be adjustable in frequency and shape due to the various transfer functions found throughout the hardware, structures, and the air or surface mediums
* Continuously Variable Generator: Spectral density, quantity, level effects, resonance, articulation functions, amplitude and frequency variations, content, quality and fidelity, speech fragmentation, spectrum shaping, periodic pauses and interruptions, tonal and pitch qualities, and other improbable vocal effects
